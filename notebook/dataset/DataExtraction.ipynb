    "##### 1) What is Crude Oil? \n",
    "- Crude oil is a highly complex hydrocarbon mixture containing over 10,000 distinct components. Its physicochemical properties (such as viscosity and chemical composition) vary significantly between different oil fields and even between batches from the same field. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2) Crude Oil Characterization (CDU)\n",
    "- In a petroleum refinery, the Crude Distillation Unit (CDU) separates this raw feedstock into valuable products like naphtha, kerosene, and diesel. To optimize the temperature and pressure profiles of the CDU, refinery operators require precise, real-time knowledge of the incoming crude oil’s properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3) Limitations of Traditional Analysis\n",
    "- Laboratory Assays (Time Lag): Standardized tests (ASTM methods) to determine properties like Kinematic Viscosity or PNA (Paraffin, Naphthene, Aromatic) composition are time-consuming, often taking 4 to 8 hours. This delay creates a significant dead time between sampling and decision-making, during which the crude has already been processed, potentially leading to off-specification production and energy wastage. Also, these tests require large sample volumes and hazardous chemical reagents.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mathematical Correlations (Inaccuracy):To save time, refineries often use mathematical correlations to estimate crude properties, but they often fail to capture the highly non-linear relationships between crude oil components. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4) Problem Statement\n",
    "- This project investigates how critical crude oil qualities (Chemical Composition and Viscosity) are determined by readily available physical attributes such as Density, Sulfur content, and Distillation Profile."
